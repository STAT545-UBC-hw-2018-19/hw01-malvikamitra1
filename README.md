```R
whatsyour <- function(x) {
    # Determines whether your function is Conjunction or Junction based on
    # arbitrary criteria
    #
    # Args:
    #   x: A number of some sort. Or not, that works too (We're not picky)
    #
    # Returns:
    #   The truth.
    if(x > 1) {
        print('Conjunction')
    }
    else {
        print('Junction')
    }
}
